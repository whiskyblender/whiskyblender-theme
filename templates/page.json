Don't try to make Johnnie Walker - try to make one for yersel, Johnnie Worker! </p><p>For the geeks, yes, we know you all too well. The whiskies for blending are unmolested  single cask scotch whisky varieties - aside from being cut to 46%abv for an easy life. We use minimal filtration to retain as much original mouthfeel as possible, though we remove as much charcoal and other bits of wid as possible.<br/><br/>Let us know on social media (or email if you'd prefer) what you think of your whisky and give us your tasting notes!
